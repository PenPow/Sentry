# Frozen Punishments

:::caution &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🏗️ 🚧 Construction Ahead

This article is under construction.

:::

When you create a punishment, it is considered unfrozen. This allows moderators to modify it (such as changing the reason, duration, etc). This can be useful as it allows for details to be added later.

However this also introduces the potential possibility for corruption and hiding tracks. Therefore, punishments can be frozen (presently by any moderator, however with [Permissions V2](/docs/concepts/PermissionsV2) this will change to administrators and above). We will also eventually roll out a setting which can freeze punishments on creation.

When a punishment is frozen, it cannot be edited, nor can it be "thawed". This effectively locks the punishment so it cannot be modified.
