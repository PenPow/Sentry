## What is Sentry

Sentry is a Discord bot that focuses on slotting into your modeeration team. Unlike other bots, Sentry provides a simple experience, while still having the ability to be incredibly powerful and configurable.

Backed by our [open-source code](https://github.com/PenPow/Sentry), we release frequent updates, making use of the latest Discord features to create a seamless moderation experience.

From native automod integration, to logging and anti-raid functionalities, Sentry protects your entire server.
