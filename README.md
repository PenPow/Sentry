## About

Sentry is a moderation bot that compliments your server, working for your moderators as opposed to agains them.

We aim to remain up-to-date with new arrivals from Discord and to integrate our features into them, to ensure a seamless experience.

## Notice about Self-Hosting

Sentry isn't designed to be explicitly self-hosted, the code featured here is for our production environment.

If you want to continue and setup a self-hosted environment for Sentry, then here be dragons 🔥🐉

Support will not be provided for self-hosted instances of Sentry.
