When you create a infraction, it is considered thawed. This allows moderators to modify it (such as changing the reason, duration, etc). This can be useful as it allows for details to be added later.

However this also introduces the potential possibility for corruption and hiding tracks. Therefore, infractions can be frozen (presently by any moderator, however with [Permissions V2](/docs/concepts/PermissionsV2) this will change to administrators and above). We will also eventually roll out a setting which can freeze punishments on creation.

When a infraction is frozen, it cannot be edited, nor can it be "thawed". This effectively locks the infraction so it cannot be modified.
